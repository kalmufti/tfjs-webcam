# TensorFlow.js Webcom Multi Object detection.

Multiple object detection using COCO-SSD a pre trained model in TensorFlow.js

Feel free to fork this and use it as a quick way to start coding with TensorFlow.js directly or following some other tutorial that needs TensorFlow.js to run.

## Your Project

### ← index.html

We simply have a script tag in our HTML to grab the a version of TensorFlow.js

To user the altest version of TensorFlow.js update the script line as the the following:

```HTML
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs/dist/tf.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

However, if you want to pull in a particular version of TensorFlow.js you can do so like this:

```HTML
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@2.0.1/dist/tf.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

### ← style.css

Nothing to see here. Just styles to make the demo look prettier. You can use or ignore these as you please.

### ← script.js

All the code for using TensorFlow.js and the starting the webcom is here.
